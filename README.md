# Tiny repo to list wim sites from couchdb, postgres

I am resisting bloating up impute_missing repo by putting this here.

The goal is to write some small, tested code that loads wim sites.

It should load wim sites that need imputing for a given year

It should load wim sites that need graphics processing for a given
year
